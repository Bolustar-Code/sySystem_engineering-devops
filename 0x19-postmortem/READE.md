# 0x19-postmortem
Issue Summary:

Duration: The outage occurred on May 5th, 2024, starting at 3:00 PM (UTC) and lasted for approximately 2 hours until 5:00 PM (UTC).
Impact: The outage affected the availability of our main web application, resulting in a complete service downtime for all users. Approximately 90% of our users experienced the inability to access the application during the outage period.
Root Cause: The root cause of the outage was identified as a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, causing it to become overloaded and unable to distribute traffic effectively.
Timeline:

3:00 PM (UTC): The issue was detected when monitoring systems alerted a sudden increase in error rates and a drop in server response times.
3:05 PM (UTC): Engineers were notified of the issue through automated alerts.
3:10 PM (UTC): Initial investigation began, focusing on identifying any recent changes in the system configuration or deployment.
3:30 PM (UTC): Assumptions were made that the issue could be related to recent changes in the application code or database queries.
4:00 PM (UTC): Further investigation revealed no evidence of code or database-related issues. Attention shifted to network and infrastructure components.
4:30 PM (UTC): Load balancer configuration was identified as the potential root cause due to unusual traffic patterns observed.
4:45 PM (UTC): Incident was escalated to the infrastructure team for immediate intervention.
5:00 PM (UTC): The issue was resolved by reconfiguring the load balancer settings to optimize traffic distribution.
Root Cause and Resolution:

Root Cause: The misconfiguration in the load balancer settings led to an imbalance in traffic distribution, causing overload on certain servers and subsequent service degradation.
Resolution: The load balancer settings were adjusted to evenly distribute incoming traffic among available servers, restoring normal operation of the web application.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improvements/Fixes:
Regular audits of load balancer configurations to ensure optimal performance.
Implementation of automated testing for load balancer settings changes to prevent similar misconfigurations.
Tasks to Address the Issue:
Conduct a thorough review of load balancer configurations and document best practices.
Develop and implement automated monitoring for load balancer performance metrics.
Schedule regular load testing exercises to evaluate the scalability and resilience of the infrastructure under peak traffic conditions.
